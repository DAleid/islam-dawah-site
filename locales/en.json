      {
        "q": "Who is the God of Muslims?",
        "a": "Muslims believe in the One God (Allah), the same God worshipped by Jews and Christians. The word 'Allah' is simply the Arabic word for God, used by Arab Christians and Jews as well."
      },
      {
        "q": "Is Islam a religion of terrorism?",
        "a": "Absolutely not. Islam means peace and submission to God. Islam forbids killing innocent people and aggression. The Quran states: 'Whoever kills a soul... it is as if he had slain all mankind.' (5:32). Terrorism in all its forms is rejected in Islam."
      },
      {
        "q": "What does Islam say about women?",
        "a": "Islam honored women and granted them full rights. Women have the right to education, work, property, and inheritance. Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said: 'Women are the twin halves of men.' Women in Islam are honored as mothers, wives, daughters, and sisters."
      },
      {
        "q": "What is the difference between Islam, Christianity, and Judaism?",
        "a": "All three religions believe in One God and share many moral values. The main difference is that Islam believes God is absolutely One with no partners, and that Muhammad ﷺ is the last prophet. Muslims respect all prophets, including Jesus and Moses (peace be upon them)."
      },
      {
        "q": "How can I become a Muslim?",
        "a": "To become a Muslim, you simply need to sincerely declare the Shahada: 'I bear witness that there is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is His messenger.' No priest or special ceremony is needed. Once you make this declaration, you are a Muslim, and you can gradually learn about prayer and worship."
      },
      {
        "q": "What is the Holy Quran?",
        "a": "The Quran is the word of God revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ through the Angel Gabriel over 23 years. It is the primary source of Islamic law. It contains 114 chapters covering faith, worship, morality, stories of prophets, and guidance for life."
      },
      {
        "q": "Do Muslims believe in Jesus?",
        "a": "Yes! Muslims love and revere Jesus (peace be upon him) and consider him one of the greatest prophets. They believe in his miracles and his miraculous birth from the Virgin Mary. The difference is that Muslims consider him a prophet and messenger of God, not divine."
